					<h4>When Louisiana Seniors Needed Someone to Protect Social Security and Medicare…</h4>
					<h2>Where was Bill?</h2>
					<p>Louisiana’s seniors worked their whole lives to earn Social Security and Medicare, but Congressman Cassidy said raising the retirement age, “just didn’t hurt anyone.”.</p>
					<p>In Louisiana, there are more than 500,000 seniors on Social Security and Medicare. Without Social Security, more than half of Louisiana seniors would live in poverty. The average life expectancy is 75 in Louisiana, but Congressman Cassidy voted to raise the retirement age to 70—cutting benefits by nearly 40 percent. And he even voted to give seniors a coupon to go shop for health insurance and end Medicare as we know it. </p>

					<h4>When Hurricane Isaac Devastated Families and Businesses in Louisiana…</h4>
					<h2>Where was Bill?</h2>
					<p>LOn August 28, 2012, Hurricane Isaac damaged 59,000 homes in Louisiana and flooded many Southeast Louisiana communities. They needed help to recover and rebuild. But when it mattered the most, Congressman Cassidy voted against $291 million in disaster relief to help Southeast Louisiana communities rebuild homes and businesses. And he voted against funding West Shore Levee project to protect communities in the River Parishes. </p>
					<p>The parishes worst-hit during Hurricane Isaac have been waiting for a levee to protect them for 40 years. The West Shore Lake Pontchartrain project (“West Shore Levee” project) began with an authorization by Congress in July 1971. Like many U.S. Army Corps of Engineer projects, negotiations between local, state and federal officials continued without meaningful progress. Major flooding problems occurred in this area from Hurricanes Betsy (1965), Juan (1985), Rita (2005), and Gustav and Ike (2008).</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, on August 28, 2012, Hurricane Isaac damaged 59,000 homes, most of which flooded, and showed how badly this area needs the West Shore Levee. The town of LaPlace was devastated.</p>
					<h3>Congressman Cassidy voted against $291 Million to rebuild after Hurricane Isaac, left LaPlace without any flood protection,=.</h3>
					<h3>SEN. LANDRIEU FOUGHT & DELIVERED DISASTER RELIEF AND LEVEE FUNDING</h3>
